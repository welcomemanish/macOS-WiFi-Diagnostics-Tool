## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviours they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — including the GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, and discussions — and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by opening a GitHub issue or contacting the project maintainer directly through GitHub. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
